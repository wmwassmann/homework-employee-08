# General info

This application is designed to display an employee's information. Things are a little out of order and don't quite function as they should, but I generally see where things need to be fixed. I want to redo this in React but I don't have the time. (and I know I probably shouldn't as a submission because that would defeat the purpose of this exercise.)

# Features

1. The user will eventually be able to add as many team members as is necessary
2. The application will display the input from index.js to index.html

# Installation

The user must install the npm package before they run the apps:

```sh
npm install or i
```

# User Guide

```

# Code Style

Standard

# Technology

The following technology have been used for this project:

1. [HTML](https://whatwg.org/)
2. [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
3. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
5. [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
6. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
7. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
   I used the following packages in this application: 
   1. Inquirer
   2. Path
   3. fs
  
# Test

1. Naturally, this doesn't quite work, but the application should pass eventually pass tests in the test folder
2. You should eventually able to run them through an npm test {file}

# Status

Project status: In-progress/on-hiatus

# Future Plan

Plan for the future development of this site:

Transition into React and completely overhaul the entire application so that it utilizes these technologies:
   - States
   - Modals
   - Avatar components
   - Either MongoDB or Sequalize. Unsure which would be better to store all of this data
NOTE: I feel like this project was designed to prepare us for React - not sure why, but it feels that way. Anyway Hope to pass with a passable grade at the very least.
